title:  "The Champ Pizza"
image: the-champ.png
tags:
- pizza
- vegetarian

ingredients:
- pizza dough
- 3 red bell peppers
- 1/2 cup cashews
- 1/4 cup + 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 lemon
- 2 portabella mushrooms
- shredded whole milk mozzarella (the hard kind not the fancy kind)
- mixed greens
- balsamic vinegar
- salt and pepper

directions:
- Make the red pepper pesto (romesco) by cutting the core and seeds out of the bell peppers and roasting them slowly, then processing with the cashews, olive oil, and lemon juice to taste. If you're feeling salty (I usually am), add salt.
- Pre-bake a thin pizza crust (store bought or home made) for about 10 minutes.
- Spread the red pepper pesto from edge to edge. Doing it on a hot crust makes it easier!
- Add the portabella slices and shredded cheese
- Bake until the cheese is bubbling and looks like it is about to burn (~10 mins)
- Scatter greens dressed with balsamic vinegar, olive oil, salt and peppper on top
- Slice and enjoy!!

I grew up visiting a vegetarian restaurant (the funky kind with thrift-store dishes and mismatched cloth napkins) where the Champ was a staple menu item until the 2000s. Sometimes, now, I need to make one for myself. (NB: image made with AI and not as appetizing as the real thing)
